        FioriConf is a free, live, online international conference for the Fiori community by the Fiori community. It's all about SAP Fiori.
        </h2>

        <p class="lead">
        FioriConf aims to be the conference for every technical Fiori user: developer, architect, admin. FioriConf bridges the gap between the technical conferences like UI5con and ABAPConf and the official SAP events like TechEd. FioriConf is about the poeple that bring Fiori to live at customers. How to get the Fiori app running, deployed, solve real world problems. It is for the people that bring Fiori to life.
        </p>

        <p class="lead">
