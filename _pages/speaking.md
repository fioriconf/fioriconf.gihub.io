-   Expand your technical, professional, and personal networks.
-   Share your discoveries with a large audience.
-   Give back to the Fiori community!

## Proposing to FioriConf

### Selection process

We'll choose a selection of talks and tutorials that we feel add to the most enjoyable and engaging program for our attendees. Volunteers from the Fiori community are invited to help us pick talks, and we rely heavily on them to help us select interesting and beneficial ones for our attendees. Community volunteers and conference organizers will review anonymized submissions and collectively decide which ones to accept.

### Talks

Length: 30 minutes or up to 60 minutes

**NOTE** For online talks, these times are a hard limit and cannot be exceeded.
