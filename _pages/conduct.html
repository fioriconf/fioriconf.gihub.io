        <h2>Full Code of Conduct</h2>

        <h3>What the conference is</h3>

        <p>FioriConf is a community conference intended for networking and collaboration in the developer community.</p>

        <p>We value the participation of each member of the SAP Fiori community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. 
          
        <h3>Be Kind To Others</h3>

        <p>Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for FioriConf.</p>

        <h3>Be Respectful</h3>

        <p>Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.</p>

        <p>Harassment includes: offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; repeated or inappropriate direct messaging on conference or social media platforms; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>
