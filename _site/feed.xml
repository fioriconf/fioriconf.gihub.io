Do you want to have a community driven conference focused on Fiori? &lt;strong&gt;Be a speaker at FioriConf!&lt;/strong&gt; This is your chance to show the world your Fiori experience and to share your knowledge.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://forms.gle/wtWBv1VzutSov19NA&quot;&gt;Call for speakers formular&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how&quot;&gt;How&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go to the call for speaker form and submit your session proposal. We try to keep it as simple as possible. Besides some basic information about yourself that will (if selected as speaker) be used at your public speaker profile (name, bio, company, …) and contact information so we can reach out to you, you, you only need to provide necessary information about your presentation: title, abstract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Invest some time in coming up with a good title and a clearly articulated abstract that makes clear what the presentation will be about and why it offers value to the audience. Hint: the decision if you will present is mostly based on the abstract, and not on your bio or job title.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;topics&quot;&gt;Topics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What kind of topic we are searching for? Easy: almost everything that fits under the term Fiori:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fiori UX:&lt;/strong&gt; Design, Themes, User interaction&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fiori Elements:&lt;/strong&gt; Developing Fiori apps using Fiori Elements and RAP&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fiori Free Style:&lt;/strong&gt; Fiori with SAPUI5, Custom Apps, Plugins, Components&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personas:&lt;/strong&gt; Fiori with Personas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobile:&lt;/strong&gt; MDK based Apps, Mobile Start, Customizing of mobile solutions like Asset Manager&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;General Topics:&lt;/strong&gt; Fiori Launchpad, Architecture, Best Practices, lessons learned, UI adaption, customizations, …&lt;/li&gt;

Do you want to have a community driven conference focused on Fiori? Then this is your chance to make it happen. if you are working at a partner or at a customer, what matters most is that you are working with Fiori day in and day out. Fiori is your work, you have to make it work, you invent best practices and you thrive to make the live of your users better through Fiori. &lt;strong&gt;FioriConf is for you!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;organization-team&quot;&gt;Organization team&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently, just me, Tobias Hofmann. This should not stay this for a long time. The ABAPConf orga team may join and help making FioriConf another success story. But I am more than happy to add new persons too: as long as you work with Fiori. I want to have a conference that is independent from SAP marketing. Therefore, the organization team will be composed out of end users: customers and partners.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;program-committee&quot;&gt;Program Committee&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The program committee is responsible for making sure that the schedule of tutorials and talks is the best it can be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;responsibilities&quot;&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start the call for proposals process&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Publish blog posts announcing the CFP&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recruit keynote speakers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Review proposals as they come in and select the best talks&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build a schedule&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Publish blog posts announcing speakers and keynotes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Update schedules based on speakers’ needs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Review online talks for Code of Conduct compliance&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Recruit backup speakers in case of speakers having to back out&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;audiovideo-av-committee&quot;&gt;Audio/Video (A/V) Committee&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The A/V committee is responsible for making everything look good. They are the online streaming stream, provide the platform, and carry out the post-conference processing and upload the results to YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;responsibilities-1&quot;&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select video production and post-conference processing crew&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work with the team to ensure high quality video streams&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help keynote speakers get presentation mode working if needed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Answer lots and lots of questions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;communications-committee&quot;&gt;Communications Committee&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The communications committee is responsible for getting the word out about FioriConf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you heard the expression “never tweet” (usually said on Twitter)? This is the opposite of that. Always tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;responsibilities-2&quot;&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Publish announcements and reminders on social media, the conference blog, and more&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Review, edit, and suggest copy for the other teams’ announcements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tweet. Lots of tweeting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Boost and retweet speakers and organizers talking about the conference&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Schedule tweets announcing talks and events&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pay attention to the &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;#fioriconf&lt;/code&gt; topic on social media and mentions to &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;@fioriconf&lt;/code&gt; on Twitter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Answer questions as they come up&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;wrap-up&quot;&gt;Wrap-up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To sign up for any of the teams (or just say “put me to work”), send an email to fioriconference@gmail.com and I’ll put you on the list. I would love to have you! You do not have to have previous organizing experience.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Tobias Hofmann</name></author><category term="General" /><summary type="html">Do you want to help make FioriConf a reality?
