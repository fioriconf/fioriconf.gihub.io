[Call for speakers formular]({{ site.cfs_link }})


## How

Go to the call for speaker form and submit your session proposal. We try to keep it as simple as possible. Besides some basic information about yourself that will (if selected as speaker) be used at your public speaker profile (name, bio, company, ...) and contact information so we can reach out to you, you, you only need to provide necessary information about your presentation: title, abstract. 

Invest some time in coming up with a good title and a clearly articulated abstract that makes clear what the presentation will be about and why it offers value to the audience. Hint: the decision if you will present is mostly based on the abstract, and not on your bio or job title.
