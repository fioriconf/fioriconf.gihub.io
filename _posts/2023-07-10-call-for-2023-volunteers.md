---

Do you want to help make FioriConf a reality? Do you want to have a community driven conference focused on Fiori? Then this is your chance to make it happen. if you are working at a partner or at a customer, what matters most is that you are working with Fiori day in and day out. Fiori is your work, you have to make it work, you invent best practices and you thrive to make the live of your users better through Fiori. **FioriConf is for you!**


## Organization team

Currently, just me, Tobias Hofmann. This should not stay this for a long time. The ABAPConf orga team may join and help making FioriConf another success story. But I am more than happy to add new persons too: as long as you work with Fiori. I want to have a conference that is independent from SAP marketing. Therefore, the organization team will be composed out of end users: customers and partners.

## Program Committee

The program committee is responsible for making sure that the schedule of tutorials and talks is the best it can be.

### Responsibilities

- Start the call for proposals process
- Publish blog posts announcing the CFP
- Recruit keynote speakers
- Review proposals as they come in and select the best talks
- Build a schedule
- Publish blog posts announcing speakers and keynotes
- Update schedules based on speakers' needs
- Review online talks for Code of Conduct compliance
- Recruit backup speakers in case of speakers having to back out

## Audio/Video (A/V) Committee

The A/V committee is responsible for making everything look good. They are the online streaming stream, provide the platform, and carry out the post-conference processing and upload the results to YouTube.

### Responsibilities

- Select video production and post-conference processing crew
- Work with the team to ensure high quality video streams
- Help keynote speakers get presentation mode working if needed
- Answer lots and lots of questions

## Communications Committee

The communications committee is responsible for getting the word out about FioriConf.

Have you heard the expression "never tweet" (usually said on Twitter)? This is the opposite of that. Always tweet.

### Responsibilities

- Publish announcements and reminders on social media, the conference blog, and more
- Review, edit, and suggest copy for the other teams' announcements
- Tweet. Lots of tweeting.
- Boost and retweet speakers and organizers talking about the conference
- Schedule tweets announcing talks and events
- Pay attention to the `#fioriconf` topic on social media and mentions to `@fioriconf` on Twitter
- Answer questions as they come up

## Wrap-up

To sign up for any of the teams (or just say "put me to work"), send an email to fioriconference@gmail.com and I'll put you on the list. I would love to have you! You do not have to have previous organizing experience.
