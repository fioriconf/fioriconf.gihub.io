I developed my first ABAP Report in 1990. At that time, it was in R/2 4.2. Much has changed over the years, but one thing stayed the same - I am still passionate about writing great SAP Applications and I like to share my knowledge. I am a co-founder of the SAP Inside Track Vienna #sitVIE and I also organize other community events like CodeRetreats, Stammtisch or Webinars in Vienna / Austria. I have two children, I like to play games on my original old game consoles and from time to time I partie in front of Rock Bands’ stages.
